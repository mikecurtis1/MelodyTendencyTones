	<h1>Tendency Tones Melody</h1>
	<div class="description">
		<p>
		Tendency Tones Melody is javascript application to generate a random melody which 
		implements melodic <i>tendency tone</i> rules as given by Kent Kennan in his 
		book &ldquo;<a href="https://archive.org/details/KennanKentCounterpoint4thEd" target="_blank">Counterpoint</a>&rdquo;. 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Scale degree <span class="music_symbols">^7</span> tends to resolve to <span class="music_symbols">^1</span></li>
			<li><span class="music_symbols">^4</span> tends to resolve to <span class="music_symbols">^3</span></li>
			<li><span class="music_symbols">^6</span> tends to resolve to <span class="music_symbols">^5</span></li>
			<li>To a lesser extent <span class="music_symbols">^2</span> tends to resolve to <span class="music_symbols">^1</span></li>
			<li>Any tendency tone - <span class="music_symbols">^7</span>, <span class="music_symbols">^4</span>, <span class="music_symbols">^6</span>, or <span class="music_symbols">^2</span> - may move to another tendency tone, resolution follows the last tendency tone of series of tendency tones</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		The follow exceptions are possible for moving contrary to a tendency tone's normal resolution.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="music_symbols">^7</span> when preceeded by <span class="music_symbols">^1</span> may continue to <span class="music_symbols">^6</span> as (<span class="music_symbols">^1 ^7 ^6</span>)</li>
			<li><span class="music_symbols">^4</span> when preceeded by <span class="music_symbols">^3</span> may continue to <span class="music_symbols">^5</span> as (<span class="music_symbols">^3 ^4 ^5</span>)</li>
			<li><span class="music_symbols">^6</span> when preceeded by <span class="music_symbols">^5</span> may continue to <span class="music_symbols">^7</span> as (<span class="music_symbols">^5 ^6 ^7</span>)</li>
			<li><span class="music_symbols">^2</span> when preceeded by <span class="music_symbols">^1</span> may continue to <span class="music_symbols">^3</span> as (<span class="music_symbols">^1 ^2 ^3</span>)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		I add to Keenan's tendency tone rule these simple points:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Limit the range of the melody to a <i>perfect eleventh</i> (<span class="music_symbols">P11</span>), specifically <span class="music_symbols">B3</span> to <span class="music_symbols">E5</span></li>
			<li>Each melody tone should not repeat either of the two previous tones</li>
			<li>No more than two consecutive tendency tones</li>
			<li>Conclude the melody line with either a <i>half cadence</i> or <i>authentic cadence</i></li>
		</ul>

		Harmonically some scale degree have one clear chord association while other can be associated with multiple chords and therefore are harmonically ambiguous. 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Scale degrees <span class="music_symbols">^1</span> and <span class="music_symbols">^3</span> are clearly assoicated with <span class="music_symbols">I</span> while scale degree <span class="music_symbols">^7</span> is clearly associated with <span class="music_symbols">V</span>. </li>
			<li>Scale degree <span class="music_symbols">^6</span> is usually assoicated with <span class="music_symbols">IV</span>, however in a line like <span class="music_symbols">^7 ^6 ^5</span> degree <span class="music_symbols">^6</span> seems to be part of a <i>retrogression</i> (<span class="music_symbols">V IV V</span>.) In such cases <span class="music_symbols">^6</span> can be harmonized as <span class="music_symbols">V/V</span>.</li>
			<li>Scale degree <span class="music_symbols">^5</span> can be harmonized with either <span class="music_symbols">I</span> or <span class="music_symbols">V</span>.</li>
			<li>Scale degrees <span class="music_symbols">^2</span> and <span class="music_symbols">^4</span> can be harmonized with either <span class="music_symbols">IV</span> or <span class="music_symbols">V</span>. Their tendency tone resolution alone does not determine the 
			harmonization (ex. <span class="music_symbols">^4</span> to <span class="music_symbols">^3</span> can be either <span class="music_symbols">IV I</span> or <span class="music_symbols">V7 I</span>.)</li>
			<li>In the case of <span class="music_symbols">^4</span> the melodic direction has bearing. Degree <span class="music_symbols">^4</span> ascending to <span class="music_symbols">^5</span> with harmonization <span class="music_symbols">V7 I</span> would be an irregular resolution.</li>
			<li>A possibility for <span class="music_symbols">^4</span> ascending to <span class="music_symbols">^5</span> is a <i>voice exchange</i> as <span class="music_symbols">V7</span> to another voicing of <span class="music_symbols">V7</span>.</li>
			<li>In any event if a harmonization presents a retrogression (ex. <span class="music_symbols">^7</span> to <span class="music_symbols">^2</span> harmonized with <span class="music_symbols">V IV</span>) an alternative is to harmonize the second chord as another <span class="music_symbols">V</span> or possibly <span class="music_symbols">V/V</span>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		The final melody is presented in unmetered whole notes. It could be realized in various meters, rhythms, and with ornamentation. 
		One consideration when choosing rhythms is the melodic tendency to <i>leap to weak beats</i>. This works well with leaps that are &ldquo;filled&rdquo; 
		by a step. Leaps among tonic chord tones, or other clear chord groups, or leaps between tendency tones could be played with even rhythm values.
